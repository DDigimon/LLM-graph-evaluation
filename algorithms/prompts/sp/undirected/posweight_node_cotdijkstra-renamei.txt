Q: Determine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. The graph is: G describes an undirected graph among 63283, 75646, 19561, 26163, and 12368.
In this graph:
Node 63283 is connected to nodes 75646 (weight: 8).
Node 75646 is connected to nodes 63283 (weight: 8).
 The question is: Does a path exist from node 12368 to node 26163? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 12368 to node 26163 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 12368.
- Set the distance to node 12368 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node 12368 (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 12368, we cannot reach any node.

ConclusionWe have now considered all possible paths from node 12368 and updated the distances accordingly. Unfortunately, node 26163 was never reached in our exploration, indicating that there is no path from node 12368 to node 26163 in the graph as described.

Q: Determine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. The graph is: G describes an undirected graph among 29902, 19989, 19781, 48592, 70555, 87140, and 60517.
In this graph:
Node 19781 is connected to nodes 19989 (weight: 3), 48592 (weight: 4), 60517 (weight: 5).
Node 29902 is connected to nodes 19989 (weight: 1), 60517 (weight: 1).
Node 48592 is connected to nodes 19781 (weight: 4), 70555 (weight: 6), 87140 (weight: 9), 60517 (weight: 9).
Node 60517 is connected to nodes 29902 (weight: 1), 19781 (weight: 5), 48592 (weight: 9), 87140 (weight: 1).
Node 70555 is connected to nodes 48592 (weight: 6), 87140 (weight: 6).
Node 19989 is connected to nodes 29902 (weight: 1), 19781 (weight: 3), 87140 (weight: 4).
Node 87140 is connected to nodes 19989 (weight: 4), 48592 (weight: 9), 70555 (weight: 6), 60517 (weight: 1).
 The question is: Does a path exist from node 70555 to node 29902? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 70555 to node 29902 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 70555.
- Set the distance to node 70555 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node 70555 (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 70555, we can reach nodes 48592 and 87140. We update the distances to nodes 48592 and 87140.
  - Distance to node 48592 (from node 70555) is 6, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 87140 (from node 70555) is 6, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

2. Select node 48592 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 48592, we can reach nodes 19781, 70555, 87140 and 60517. However, nod and 70555 has already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 19781, 87140 and 60517.
  - Distance to node 19781 (from node 48592) is 10, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 87140 (from node 48592) is 15, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 60517 (from node 48592) is 15, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

3. Select node 87140 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 87140, we can reach nodes 70555, 60517, 48592 and 19989. However, nodes 70555 and 48592 have already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 60517 and 19989.
  - Distance to node 60517 (from node 87140) is 7, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 19989 (from node 87140) is 10, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

4. Select node 60517 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 60517, we can reach nodes 87140, 48592, 29902 and 19781. However, nodes 87140 and 48592 have already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 29902 and 19781.
  - Distance to node 29902 (from node 60517) is 8, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 19781 (from node 60517) is 12, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

5. Select node 29902 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 29902, we can reach nodes 19989 and 60517. However, nod and 60517 has already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 19989.
  - Distance to node 19989 (from node 29902) is 9, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

6. Select node 19989 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 19989, we can reach nodes 29902, 19781 and 87140. However, nodes 29902 and 87140 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 19781.
  - Distance to node 19781 (from node 19989) is 12, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

7. Select node 19781 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 19781, we can reach nodes 19989, 48592 and 60517. However, nodes 19989, 48592 and 60517 have already been selected. We have nothing to update.

Conclusion
A path exists from node 70555 to node 29902.
Answer: Node 70555 -> Node 87140 -> Node 60517 -> Node 29902.
