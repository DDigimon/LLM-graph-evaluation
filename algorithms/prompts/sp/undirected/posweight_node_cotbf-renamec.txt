 The question is: Does a path exist from node JZRKF to node FQWQH? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node JZRKF to node FQWQH and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found. Since the graph is undirected, we can consider each connection as bidirectional for the purpose of this explanation, but we'll follow the directed edges as described.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node JZRKF in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (8 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- Update distance to ORKDW via JZRKF: 0 + 5 = 5
- Update distance to QTWEH via ORKDW: 5 + 8 = 13
- Update distance to ZCERA via QTWEH: 13 + 5 = 18
- Update distance to FQWQH via ZCERA: 18 + 9 = 27
- Update distance to FOZDE via FQWQH: 27 + 5 = 32

Iteration 2:
- No update in a round, stop early.

Therefore, there is a path from node JZRKF to node FQWQH, and the shortest path is Node JZRKF -> Node ORKDW -> Node QTWEH -> Node ZCERA -> Node FQWQH.

Iteration 1:
- No update in a round, stop early.

By examining the graph, we notice that the graph does not show any connection between node BITKW and node ZQSRK. Therefore, based on the graph's connections, the answer is 'No path.'
