Q: Determine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. The graph is: G describes an undirected graph among 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
In this graph:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 (weight: 8).
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 (weight: 8), 2 (weight: 1).
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 (weight: 1), 3 (weight: 3).
Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 (weight: 3), 4 (weight: 3).
Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 (weight: 3), 5 (weight: 8).
Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 (weight: 8), 6 (weight: 4).
Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 (weight: 4), 7 (weight: 7).
Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 (weight: 7), 8 (weight: 4).
Node 8 is connected to nodes 7 (weight: 4).
 The question is: Does a path exist from node 4 to node 8? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 4 to node 8 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found. Since the graph is undirected, we can consider each connection as bidirectional for the purpose of this explanation, but we'll follow the directed edges as described.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node 4 in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (11 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- Update distance to 3 via 4: 0 + 3 = 3
- Update distance to 5 via 4: 0 + 8 = 8
- Update distance to 6 via 5: 8 + 4 = 12
- Update distance to 7 via 6: 12 + 7 = 19
- Update distance to 8 via 7: 19 + 4 = 23

Iteration 2:
- Update distance to 2 via 3: 3 + 3 = 6

Iteration 3:
- Update distance to 1 via 2: 6 + 1 = 7

Iteration 4:
- Update distance to 0 via 1: 7 + 8 = 15

Iteration 5:
- No update in a round, stop early.

Therefore, there is a path from node 4 to node 8, and the shortest path is Node 4 -> Node 5 -> Node 6 -> Node 7 -> Node 8.
