  - Distance to node 0 (from node 10) is 12, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 8 (from node 10) is 12, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 11 (from node 10) is 9, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 14 (from node 10) is 9, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

4. Select node 3 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 3, we can reach nodes 0, 1, 8, 13, 11 and 14. However, nodes 1 and 13 have already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 0, 8, 11 and 14.
  - Distance to node 0 (from node 3) is 12, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 8 (from node 3) is 8, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 11 (from node 3) is 14, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 14 (from node 3) is 9, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

5. Select node 11 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 11, we can reach nodes 0, 1, 3, 8, 10 and 13. However, nodes 1, 3, 10 and 13 have already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 0 and 8.
  - Distance to node 0 (from node 11) is 7, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 8 (from node 11) is 11, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

6. Select node 0 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 0, we can reach nodes 11, 3, 13, 14 and 10. However, nodes 11, 3, 13 and 10 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 14.
  - Distance to node 14 (from node 0) is 8, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

7. Select node 8 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 8, we can reach nodes 3, 10, 14, 11 and 13. However, nodes 3, 10, 11 and 13 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 14.
  - Distance to node 14 (from node 8) is 13, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

8. Select node 14 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 14, we can reach nodes 0, 3, 8 and 10. However, nodes 0, 3, 8 and 10 have already been selected. We have nothing to update.

ConclusionWe have now considered all possible paths from node 1 and updated the distances accordingly. Unfortunately, node 7 was never reached in our exploration, indicating that there is no path from node 1 to node 7 in the graph as described.
Answer: No path.
