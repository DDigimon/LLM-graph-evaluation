 The question is: Does a path exist from node 65496 to node 77432? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 65496 to node 77432 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found. Since the graph is undirected, we can consider each connection as bidirectional for the purpose of this explanation, but we'll follow the directed edges as described.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node 65496 in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (12 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- Update distance to 1402 via 65496: 0 + 2 = 2
- Update distance to 60153 via 65496: 0 + 8 = 8
- Update distance to 89291 via 65496: 0 + 1 = 1
- Update distance to 36555 via 65496: 0 + 5 = 5
- Update distance to 21973 via 1402: 2 + 7 = 9
- Update distance to 87840 via 21973: 9 + 7 = 16
- Update distance to 21973 via 89291: 1 + 1 = 2
- Update distance to 60153 via 36555: 5 + 1 = 6

Iteration 2:
- Update distance to 94157 via 87840: 16 + 2 = 18
- Update distance to 91058 via 94157: 18 + 6 = 24
- Update distance to 18702 via 94157: 18 + 3 = 21
- Update distance to 813 via 87840: 16 + 3 = 19
- Update distance to 87840 via 21973: 2 + 7 = 9
- Update distance to 77432 via 813: 19 + 7 = 26
- Update distance to 91058 via 813: 19 + 4 = 23

Iteration 3:
- Update distance to 94157 via 87840: 9 + 2 = 11
- Update distance to 91058 via 94157: 11 + 6 = 17
- Update distance to 18702 via 94157: 11 + 3 = 14
- Update distance to 813 via 87840: 9 + 3 = 12
- Update distance to 77432 via 813: 12 + 7 = 19
- Update distance to 91058 via 813: 12 + 4 = 16

Iteration 4:
- No update in a round, stop early.

Therefore, there is a path from node 65496 to node 77432, and the shortest path is Node 65496 -> Node 89291 -> Node 21973 -> Node 87840 -> Node 813 -> Node 77432.

 The question is: Does a path exist from node 5103 to node 30442? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 5103 to node 30442 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found. Since the graph is undirected, we can consider each connection as bidirectional for the purpose of this explanation, but we'll follow the directed edges as described.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node 5103 in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (12 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- Update distance to 18320 via 5103: 0 + 4 = 4
- Update distance to 7693 via 5103: 0 + 9 = 9
- Update distance to 51542 via 5103: 0 + 6 = 6
- Update distance to 19502 via 5103: 0 + 4 = 4
- Update distance to 7693 via 19502: 4 + 1 = 5
- Update distance to 18260 via 19502: 4 + 8 = 12
- Update distance to 57346 via 19502: 4 + 3 = 7
- Update distance to 91718 via 19502: 4 + 4 = 8
- Update distance to 4967 via 19502: 4 + 8 = 12
- Update distance to 10127 via 4967: 12 + 8 = 20
- Update distance to 4967 via 7693: 5 + 3 = 8
- Update distance to 10127 via 51542: 6 + 8 = 14
- Update distance to 10127 via 57346: 7 + 3 = 10
- Update distance to 10127 via 7693: 5 + 1 = 6
- Update distance to 18260 via 18320: 4 + 4 = 8

Iteration 2:
- Update distance to 30442 via 10127: 6 + 5 = 11
- Update distance to 30442 via 91718: 8 + 2 = 10
- Update distance to 90112 via 30442: 10 + 7 = 17
- Update distance to 90112 via 10127: 6 + 5 = 11
- Update distance to 90112 via 51542: 6 + 1 = 7

Iteration 3:
- No update in a round, stop early.

Therefore, there is a path from node 5103 to node 30442, and the shortest path is Node 5103 -> Node 19502 -> Node 91718 -> Node 30442.
