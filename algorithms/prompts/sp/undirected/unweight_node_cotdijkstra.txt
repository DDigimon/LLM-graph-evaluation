Q: Determine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. The graph is: G describes an undirected graph among 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
In this graph:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 2, 3.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 3, 2.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 3.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3.
 The question is: Does a path exist from node 4 to node 5? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm, all edges have weight 1.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 4 to node 5 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 4.
- Set the distance to node 4 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node 4 (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 4, we cannot reach any node.

ConclusionWe have now considered all possible paths from node 4 and updated the distances accordingly. Unfortunately, node 5 was never reached in our exploration, indicating that there is no path from node 4 to node 5 in the graph as described.
