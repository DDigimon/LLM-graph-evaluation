 The question is: Does a path exist from node 5 to node 2? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 5 to node 2 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 5.
- Set the distance to node 5 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process

  - Distance to node 11 (from node 4) is 5, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 1 (from node 4) is 11, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

3. Select node 11 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 11, we can reach nodes 4, 1 and 0. However, nod and 4 has already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 1 and 0.

  - Distance to node 7 (from node 1) is 12, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

5. Select node 6 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 6, we can reach nodes 9, 5 and 3. However, nod and 5 has already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 9 and 3.
  - Distance to node 9 (from node 6) is 16, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 3 (from node 6) is 8, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

6. Select node 3 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 3, we can reach nodes 10 and 6. However, nod and 6 has already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 10.
  - Distance to node 10 (from node 3) is 17, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

7. Select node 0 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 0, we can reach nodes 1, 11 and 9. However, nodes 1 and 11 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 9.
  - Distance to node 9 (from node 0) is 19, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

8. Select node 7 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 7, we can reach nodes 1 and 10. However, nod and 1 has already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 10.
  - Distance to node 10 (from node 7) is 21, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

9. Select node 8 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 8, we can reach nod and 1. However, nod and 1 has already been selected. We have nothing to update.

 The question is: Does a path exist from node 1 to node 13? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 1 to node 13 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:
