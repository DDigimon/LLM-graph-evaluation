Q: Determine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. The graph is: G describes an undirected graph among node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
Node 0 is connected to Node 2.
Node 1 is connected to Node 3.
Node 2 is connected to Node 6.
Node 2 is connected to Node 5.
Node 3 is connected to Node 4.
Node 4 is connected to Node 7.
Node 5 is connected to Node 6.
Node 6 is connected to Node 7.
 The question is: Does a path exist from node 0 to node 1? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm, all edges have weight 1.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 0 to node 1 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 0.
- Set the distance to node 0 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node 0 (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 0, we can reach nod and 2. We update the distance to nod and 2.
  - Distance to node 2 (from node 0) is 1, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

2. Select node 2 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 2, we can reach nodes 0, 6 and 5. However, nod and 0 has already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 6 and 5.
  - Distance to node 6 (from node 2) is 2, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 5 (from node 2) is 2, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

3. Select node 5 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 5, we can reach nodes 6 and 2. However, nod and 2 has already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 6.
  - Distance to node 6 (from node 5) is 3, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

4. Select node 6 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 6, we can reach nodes 2, 5 and 7. However, nodes 2 and 5 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 7.
  - Distance to node 7 (from node 6) is 3, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

5. Select node 7 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 7, we can reach nodes 4 and 6. However, nod and 6 has already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 4.
  - Distance to node 4 (from node 7) is 4, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

6. Select node 4 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 4, we can reach nodes 3 and 7. However, nod and 7 has already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 3.
  - Distance to node 3 (from node 4) is 5, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

7. Select node 3 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 3, we can reach nodes 1 and 4. However, nod and 4 has already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 1.
  - Distance to node 1 (from node 3) is 6, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

8. Select node 1 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 1, we can reach nod and 3. However, nod and 3 has already been selected. We have nothing to update.

Node 10 is connected to Node 11.
 The question is: Does a path exist from node 11 to node 3? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm, all edges have weight 1.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 11 to node 3 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 11.
- Set the distance to node 11 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node 11 (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 11, we can reach nodes 10 and 6. We update the distances to nodes 10 and 6.
  - Distance to node 10 (from node 11) is 1, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 6 (from node 11) is 1, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

2. Select node 6 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 6, we can reach nodes 5, 7, 10, 9 and 11. However, nod and 11 has already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 5, 7, 10 and 9.
  - Distance to node 5 (from node 6) is 2, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 7 (from node 6) is 2, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 10 (from node 6) is 2, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

4. Select node 1 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 1, we can reach nodes 0, 2, 10 and 4. However, nod and 10 has already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 0, 2 and 4.
  - Distance to node 0 (from node 1) is 3, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 2 (from node 1) is 3, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 4 (from node 1) is 3, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

5. Select node 5 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 5, we can reach nodes 4 and 6. However, nod and 6 has already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 4.
  - Distance to node 4 (from node 5) is 3, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

6. Select node 7 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 7, we can reach nodes 6, 8 and 4. However, nod and 6 has already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 8 and 4.
  - Distance to node 8 (from node 7) is 3, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 4 (from node 7) is 3, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

7. Select node 9 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 9, we can reach nodes 8, 10, 2 and 6. However, nodes 10 and 6 have already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 8 and 2.
  - Distance to node 8 (from node 9) is 3, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 2 (from node 9) is 3, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

8. Select node 0 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 0, we can reach nod and 1. However, nod and 1 has already been selected. We have nothing to update.

9. Select node 2 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 2, we can reach nodes 1, 3 and 9. However, nodes 1 and 9 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 3.
  - Distance to node 3 (from node 2) is 4, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

10. Select node 4 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 4, we can reach nodes 3, 5, 7 and 1. However, nodes 5, 7 and 1 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 3.
