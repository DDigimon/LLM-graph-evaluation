A: To determine if there is a path from node 232 to node 41225 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Q: Determine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. The graph is: G describes an undirected graph among 36071, 64101, 95666, 40804, 27529, 34672, and 96682.
In this graph:
Node 27529 is connected to nodes 40804.
Node 64101 is connected to nodes 36071, 95666.
Node 36071 is connected to nodes 64101.
Node 95666 is connected to nodes 64101, 40804.
Node 40804 is connected to nodes 95666, 27529.
 The question is: Does a path exist from node 27529 to node 36071? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm, all edges have weight 1.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 27529 to node 36071 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 27529.
- Set the distance to node 27529 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node 27529 (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 27529, we can reach nod and 40804. We update the distance to nod and 40804.
  - Distance to node 40804 (from node 27529) is 1, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

2. Select node 40804 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 40804, we can reach nodes 95666 and 27529. However, nod and 27529 has already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 95666.
  - Distance to node 95666 (from node 40804) is 2, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

3. Select node 95666 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 95666, we can reach nodes 64101 and 40804. However, nod and 40804 has already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 64101.
  - Distance to node 64101 (from node 95666) is 3, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

4. Select node 64101 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 64101, we can reach nodes 36071 and 95666. However, nod and 95666 has already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 36071.
  - Distance to node 36071 (from node 64101) is 4, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

5. Select node 36071 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 36071, we can reach nod and 64101. However, nod and 64101 has already been selected. We have nothing to update.

A path exists from node 27529 to node 36071.
Answer: Node 27529 -> Node 40804 -> Node 95666 -> Node 64101 -> Node 36071.

ConclusionWe have now considered all possible paths from node 99402 and updated the distances accordingly. Unfortunately, node 72962 was never reached in our exploration, indicating that there is no path from node 99402 to node 72962 in the graph as described.
