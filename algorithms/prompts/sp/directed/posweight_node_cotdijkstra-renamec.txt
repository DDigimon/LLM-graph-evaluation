 Does a path exist from node RURFG to node PZENI? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node RURFG to node PZENI and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node RURFG.
- Set the distance to node RURFG (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node RURFG (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node RURFG, we cannot reach any node.

ConclusionWe have now considered all possible paths from node RURFG and updated the distances accordingly. Unfortunately, node PZENI was never reached in our exploration, indicating that there is no path from node RURFG to node PZENI in the graph as described.
Answer: No path.

  - Distance to node LRPIM (from node QHCHX) is 15, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

6. Select node GPSHS (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node GPSHS, we can reach nodes LRPIM, TJJTQ, ZQXAU and DKWPD. However, nodes TJJTQ, ZQXAU and DKWPD have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and LRPIM.
  - Distance to node LRPIM (from node GPSHS) is 12, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.
