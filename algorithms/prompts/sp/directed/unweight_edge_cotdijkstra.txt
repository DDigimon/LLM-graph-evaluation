 Does a path exist from node 8 to node 3? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm, all edges have weight 1.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 8 to node 3 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 8.
- Set the distance to node 8 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node 8 (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 8, we can reach nodes 9, 11, 5, 6, 7, 10, 0, 3, 2 and 12. We update the distances to nodes 9, 11, 5, 6, 7, 10, 0, 3, 2 and 12.

 Does a path exist from node 0 to node 10? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm, all edges have weight 1.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 0 to node 10 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 0.
- Set the distance to node 0 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.

  - Distance to node 3 (from node 5) is 4, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

9. Select node 9 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 9, we can reach nodes 2, 10 and 4. However, nodes 2, 10 and 4 have already been selected. We have nothing to update.

10. Select node 3 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 3, we can reach nodes 10, 9, 8 and 0. However, nodes 10, 9, 8 and 0 have already been selected. We have nothing to update.

11. Select node 6 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 6, we can reach nodes 9, 7, 1, 2 and 5. However, nodes 9, 7, 1, 2 and 5 have already been selected. We have nothing to update.

Conclusion
A path exists from node 7 to node 6.
Answer: Node 7 -> Node 0 -> Node 8 -> Node 1 -> Node 6.
