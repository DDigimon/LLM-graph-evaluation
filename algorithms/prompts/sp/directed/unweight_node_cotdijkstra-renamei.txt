Q: Given a directed graph: G describes a directed graph among 31591, 42517, 50251, 6611, and 70826.
In this graph:
Node 31591 is directed to nodes 42517, 50251, 6611.
Node 42517 is directed to nodes 50251, 31591, 70826, 6611.

Node 70826 is directed to nodes 31591, 42517.
 Does a path exist from node 50251 to node 70826? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm, all edges have weight 1.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 50251 to node 70826 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 50251.
- Set the distance to node 50251 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node 50251 (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 50251, we can reach nodes 6611, 42517 and 31591. We update the distances to nodes 6611, 42517 and 31591.
  - Distance to node 6611 (from node 50251) is 1, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 42517 (from node 50251) is 1, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 31591 (from node 50251) is 1, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

2. Select node 31591 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 31591, we can reach nodes 42517, 50251 and 6611. However, nod and 50251 has already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 42517 and 6611.
  - Distance to node 42517 (from node 31591) is 2, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 6611 (from node 31591) is 2, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

3. Select node 42517 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 42517, we can reach nodes 50251, 31591, 70826 and 6611. However, nodes 50251 and 31591 have already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 70826 and 6611.
  - Distance to node 70826 (from node 42517) is 2, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 6611 (from node 42517) is 2, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

4. Select node 6611 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 6611, we can reach nodes 70826, 31591, 42517 and 50251. However, nodes 31591, 42517 and 50251 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 70826.
  - Distance to node 70826 (from node 6611) is 2, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

5. Select node 70826 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 70826, we can reach nodes 31591 and 42517. However, nodes 31591 and 42517 have already been selected. We have nothing to update.

A path exists from node 50251 to node 70826.
Answer: Node 50251 -> Node 42517 -> Node 70826.

A: To determine if there is a path from node 48902 to node 45688 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 48902.
- Set the distance to node 48902 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.

A: To determine if there is a path from node 22087 to node 49730 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:
