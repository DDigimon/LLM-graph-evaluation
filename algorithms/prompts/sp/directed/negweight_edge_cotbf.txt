 Does a path exist from node 2 to node 0? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 2 to node 0 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node 2 in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (6 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- Update distance to 4 via 2: 0 + 2 = 2
- Update distance to 5 via 2: 0 + 6 = 6
- Update distance to 1 via 2: 0 + 0 = 0
- Update distance to 3 via 4: 2 + 8 = 10
- Update distance to 0 via 4: 2 + 7 = 9

Iteration 2:
- Update distance to 0 via 1: 0 + 7 = 7
- Update distance to 3 via 1: 0 + 8 = 8
- Update distance to 5 via 1: 0 + 4 = 4

Iteration 3:
- No update in a round, stop early.

Therefore, there is a path from node 2 to node 0, and the shortest path is Node 2 -> Node 1 -> Node 0.

- Update distance to 1 via 2: 3 + 3 = 6
- Update distance to 5 via 2: 3 + -3 = 0
- Update distance to 10 via 3: 4 + 2 = 6
- Update distance to 9 via 3: 4 + -3 = 1
- Update distance to 7 via 3: 4 + 5 = 9
- Update distance to 4 via 3: 4 + 2 = 6
- Update distance to 7 via 4: 6 + -2 = 4
- Update distance to 4 via 6: 0 + 0 = 0

Iteration 3:
- Update distance to 7 via 4: 0 + -2 = -2
- Update distance to 10 via 7: -2 + 2 = 0
- Update distance to 5 via 10: 0 + -2 = -2

Iteration 4:
- No update in a round, stop early.

Therefore, there is a path from node 8 to node 7, and the shortest path is Node 8 -> Node 0 -> Node 2 -> Node 6 -> Node 4 -> Node 7.
