 Does a path exist from node 73829 to node 44161? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 73829 to node 44161 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 73829.
- Set the distance to node 73829 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node 73829 (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 73829, we can reach nodes 15805 and 67846. We update the distances to nodes 15805 and 67846.

  - Distance to node 67846 (from node 73829) is 2, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

2. Select node 67846 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 67846, we cannot reach any node.

3. Select node 15805 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 15805, we can reach nodes 73829, 79676 and 40990. However, nod and 73829 has already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 79676 and 40990.
  - Distance to node 79676 (from node 15805) is 14, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 40990 (from node 15805) is 14, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

4. Select node 40990 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 40990, we can reach nodes 67846 and 15805. However, nodes 67846 and 15805 have already been selected. We have nothing to update.

5. Select node 79676 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 79676, we can reach nod and 40990. However, nod and 40990 has already been selected. We have nothing to update.

ConclusionWe have now considered all possible paths from node 73829 and updated the distances accordingly. Unfortunately, node 44161 was never reached in our exploration, indicating that there is no path from node 73829 to node 44161 in the graph as described.

 Does a path exist from node 27156 to node 2477? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 27156 to node 2477 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 27156.

  - Distance to node 55212 (from node 64617) is 13, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

13. Select node 55212 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 55212, we can reach nodes 17983, 61458, 41330 and 39820. However, nodes 17983, 61458, 41330 and 39820 have already been selected. We have nothing to update.

ConclusionWe have now considered all possible paths from node 39820 and updated the distances accordingly. Unfortunately, node 61563 was never reached in our exploration, indicating that there is no path from node 39820 to node 61563 in the graph as described.
Answer: No path.
