Q: Given a directed graph: G describes a directed graph among 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.
In this graph:

 Does a path exist from node 8 to node 12? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm, all edges have weight 1.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 8 to node 12 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 8.
- Set the distance to node 8 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node 8 (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 8, we cannot reach any node.

ConclusionWe have now considered all possible paths from node 8 and updated the distances accordingly. Unfortunately, node 12 was never reached in our exploration, indicating that there is no path from node 8 to node 12 in the graph as described.

  - Distance to node 8 (from node 7) is 3, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

8. Select node 1 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 1, we can reach nodes 2, 3, 10 and 0. However, nodes 2, 10 and 0 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 3.
  - Distance to node 3 (from node 1) is 4, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

9. Select node 3 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 3, we can reach nodes 4, 10, 9 and 1. However, nodes 4, 10 and 1 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 9.
  - Distance to node 9 (from node 3) is 4, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

10. Select node 8 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 8, we can reach nodes 9, 4, 7 and 10. However, nodes 4, 7 and 10 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 9.
  - Distance to node 9 (from node 8) is 4, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

11. Select node 9 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 9, we can reach nodes 10, 1, 4 and 0. However, nodes 10, 1, 4 and 0 have already been selected. We have nothing to update.

Conclusion
A path exists from node 5 to node 9.
Answer: Node 5 -> Node 4 -> Node 2 -> Node 3 -> Node 9.
