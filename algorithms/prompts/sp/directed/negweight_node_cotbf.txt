 Does a path exist from node 11 to node 14? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 11 to node 14 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node 11 in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (15 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- Update distance to 10 via 11: 0 + 3 = 3
- Update distance to 3 via 11: 0 + 8 = 8
- Update distance to 1 via 11: 0 + 3 = 3

Iteration 2:
- Update distance to 2 via 1: 3 + 2 = 5
- Update distance to 0 via 1: 3 + -1 = 2
- Update distance to 8 via 2: 5 + 0 = 5
- Update distance to 6 via 2: 5 + 2 = 7
- Update distance to 9 via 3: 8 + 1 = 9
- Update distance to 12 via 8: 5 + 5 = 10
- Update distance to 7 via 8: 5 + 2 = 7
- Update distance to 5 via 8: 5 + 0 = 5
- Update distance to 9 via 8: 5 + 1 = 6
- Update distance to 3 via 9: 6 + 0 = 6
- Update distance to 4 via 10: 3 + 2 = 5
- Update distance to 14 via 12: 10 + -1 = 9

Iteration 3:
- Update distance to 10 via 5: 5 + -3 = 2
- Update distance to 4 via 10: 2 + 2 = 4

Iteration 4:
- No update in a round, stop early.

Therefore, there is a path from node 11 to node 14, and the shortest path is Node 11 -> Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 8 -> Node 12 -> Node 14.

Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node 7 in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (10 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- Update distance to 8 via 7: 0 + -2 = -2
- Update distance to 9 via 7: 0 + 5 = 5
- Update distance to 3 via 7: 0 + 5 = 5
- Update distance to 0 via 7: 0 + -2 = -2
- Update distance to 4 via 7: 0 + 5 = 5
- Update distance to 9 via 8: -2 + 6 = 4
- Update distance to 3 via 8: -2 + 5 = 3
- Update distance to 6 via 9: 4 + 6 = 10
- Update distance to 5 via 9: 4 + 5 = 9

Iteration 2:
- Update distance to 6 via 0: -2 + 5 = 3
- Update distance to 2 via 0: -2 + 2 = 0
- Update distance to 9 via 2: 0 + 3 = 3
- Update distance to 5 via 2: 0 + 8 = 8
- Update distance to 1 via 2: 0 + 4 = 4
- Update distance to 5 via 3: 3 + 3 = 6
- Update distance to 3 via 4: 5 + -3 = 2
- Update distance to 3 via 6: 3 + -2 = 1

Iteration 3:
- Update distance to 4 via 1: 4 + -2 = 2
- Update distance to 5 via 3: 1 + 3 = 4
- Update distance to 3 via 4: 2 + -3 = -1

Iteration 4:
- Update distance to 5 via 3: -1 + 3 = 2

Iteration 5:
- No update in a round, stop early.

Therefore, there is a path from node 7 to node 4, and the shortest path is Node 7 -> Node 0 -> Node 2 -> Node 1 -> Node 4.
