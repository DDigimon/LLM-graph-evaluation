A: To determine if there is a path from node POYVL to node EUHOI and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node POYVL in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (15 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- Update distance to EXVTF via POYVL: 0 + 4 = 4
- Update distance to UGVLQ via POYVL: 0 + 5 = 5
- Update distance to VTZMF via EXVTF: 4 + 7 = 11
- Update distance to CBFQW via VTZMF: 11 + 2 = 13
- Update distance to XTUNW via VTZMF: 11 + 6 = 17
- Update distance to TWKMM via VTZMF: 11 + 7 = 18
- Update distance to SLOAM via VTZMF: 11 + 7 = 18
- Update distance to HYWEQ via SLOAM: 18 + 4 = 22
- Update distance to IINAM via SLOAM: 18 + 4 = 22
- Update distance to STQIZ via SLOAM: 18 + 8 = 26
- Update distance to EUHOI via HYWEQ: 22 + 1 = 23

- Update distance to UKWVX via UGVLQ: 5 + 2 = 7
- Update distance to IINAM via UGVLQ: 5 + 2 = 7
- Update distance to BJVYP via XTUNW: 17 + 8 = 25
- Update distance to HYWEQ via CBFQW: 13 + 5 = 18
- Update distance to BJVYP via CBFQW: 13 + 9 = 22
- Update distance to XTUNW via IINAM: 7 + 2 = 9
- Update distance to SLOAM via IINAM: 7 + 1 = 8

Iteration 2:
- Update distance to TWKMM via STQIZ: 11 + 3 = 14
- Update distance to CFCNE via TWKMM: 14 + 3 = 17
- Update distance to HYWEQ via SLOAM: 8 + 4 = 12
- Update distance to TWKMM via SLOAM: 8 + 1 = 9
- Update distance to XTUNW via UKWVX: 7 + 1 = 8
- Update distance to EUHOI via HYWEQ: 12 + 1 = 13
- Update distance to CFCNE via HYWEQ: 12 + 3 = 15
- Update distance to BJVYP via XTUNW: 8 + 8 = 16
- Update distance to STQIZ via XTUNW: 8 + 1 = 9

Iteration 3:
- Update distance to CFCNE via TWKMM: 9 + 3 = 12

Iteration 4:
- No update in a round, stop early.

Therefore, there is a path from node POYVL to node EUHOI, and the shortest path is Node POYVL -> Node UGVLQ -> Node IINAM -> Node SLOAM -> Node HYWEQ -> Node EUHOI.

 Does a path exist from node XQBKH to node BYVEB? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node XQBKH to node BYVEB and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node XQBKH in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (15 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- No update in a round, stop early.

By examining the graph, we notice that the graph does not show any connection between node XQBKH and node BYVEB. Therefore, based on the graph's connections, the answer is 'No path.'
