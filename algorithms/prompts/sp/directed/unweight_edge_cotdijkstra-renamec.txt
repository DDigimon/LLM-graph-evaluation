 Does a path exist from node WXFES to node NHMOQ? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm, all edges have weight 1.
A: To determine if there is a path from node WXFES to node NHMOQ and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node WXFES.
- Set the distance to node WXFES (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process

 Does a path exist from node OQGTM to node OVSBG? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm, all edges have weight 1.
A: To determine if there is a path from node OQGTM to node OVSBG and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node OQGTM.
- Set the distance to node OQGTM (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node OQGTM (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node OQGTM, we cannot reach any node.

ConclusionWe have now considered all possible paths from node OQGTM and updated the distances accordingly. Unfortunately, node OVSBG was never reached in our exploration, indicating that there is no path from node OQGTM to node OVSBG in the graph as described.
Answer: No path.

A: To determine if there is a path from node JXZTY to node IWWCD and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node JXZTY.
- Set the distance to node JXZTY (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node JXZTY (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node JXZTY, we can reach nodes UNAHL, EFRYM, TOCOZ, VPURA and CPVVP. We update the distances to nodes UNAHL, EFRYM, TOCOZ, VPURA and CPVVP.

  - Distance to node TOCOZ (from node VPURA) is 2, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node CPVVP (from node VPURA) is 2, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node EFRYM (from node VPURA) is 2, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

4. Select node TOCOZ (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node TOCOZ, we can reach nodes UNAHL, EFRYM, VPURA, CPVVP and JXZTY. However, nodes UNAHL, VPURA and JXZTY have already been selected. We update the distances to nodes EFRYM and CPVVP.

  - Distance to node CPVVP (from node TOCOZ) is 2, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

5. Select node CPVVP (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node CPVVP, we can reach nodes EFRYM, TOCOZ, UNAHL, VPURA and JXZTY. However, nodes TOCOZ, UNAHL, VPURA and JXZTY have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and EFRYM.
  - Distance to node EFRYM (from node CPVVP) is 2, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

6. Select node EFRYM (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node EFRYM, we can reach nodes VPURA, CPVVP, TOCOZ, UNAHL and JXZTY. However, nodes VPURA, CPVVP, TOCOZ, UNAHL and JXZTY have already been selected. We have nothing to update.

ConclusionWe have now considered all possible paths from node JXZTY and updated the distances accordingly. Unfortunately, node IWWCD was never reached in our exploration, indicating that there is no path from node JXZTY to node IWWCD in the graph as described.
