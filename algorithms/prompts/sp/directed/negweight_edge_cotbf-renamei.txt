Q: Given a directed graph: G describes a directed graph among node 39309, 22433, 7786, 27612, 33674, and 47510.
Node 39309 is directed to Node 7786 with weight 8.
Node 22433 is directed to Node 33674 with weight -1.
Node 7786 is directed to Node 47510 with weight 9.
 Does a path exist from node 22433 to node 39309? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 22433 to node 39309 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node 22433 in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (6 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- Update distance to 33674 via 22433: 0 + -1 = -1

Iteration 2:
- No update in a round, stop early.

By examining the graph, we notice that the graph does not show any connection between node 22433 and node 39309. Therefore, based on the graph's connections, the answer is 'No path.'

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (7 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- No update in a round, stop early.

By examining the graph, we notice that the graph does not show any connection between node 55801 and node 14410. Therefore, based on the graph's connections, the answer is 'No path.'

A: To determine if there is a path from node 65080 to node 82657 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node 65080 in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (9 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- Update distance to 44455 via 65080: 0 + 3 = 3
- Update distance to 12627 via 65080: 0 + 1 = 1
- Update distance to 55161 via 65080: 0 + 6 = 6

- Update distance to 574 via 44515: 9 + 0 = 9

Iteration 4:
- Update distance to 82657 via 81980: 8 + 6 = 14
