Node 9 is directed to nodes 4 (weight: 8), 3 (weight: 8), 6 (weight: 3), 5 (weight: 8).
 Does a path exist from node 7 to node 6? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 7 to node 6 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 7.
- Set the distance to node 7 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node 7 (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 7, we can reach nodes 8 and 0. We update the distances to nodes 8 and 0.
  - Distance to node 8 (from node 7) is 6, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 0 (from node 7) is 5, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

2. Select node 0 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 0, we can reach nodes 1 and 7. However, nod and 7 has already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 1.
  - Distance to node 1 (from node 0) is 8, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

3. Select node 8 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 8, we can reach nodes 7, 1 and 0. However, nodes 7 and 0 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 1.
  - Distance to node 1 (from node 8) is 14, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

4. Select node 1 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 1, we can reach nodes 8, 7, 0 and 2. However, nodes 8, 7 and 0 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 2.
  - Distance to node 2 (from node 1) is 11, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

5. Select node 2 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 2, we can reach nodes 0 and 1. However, nodes 0 and 1 have already been selected. We have nothing to update.

ConclusionWe have now considered all possible paths from node 7 and updated the distances accordingly. Unfortunately, node 6 was never reached in our exploration, indicating that there is no path from node 7 to node 6 in the graph as described.
Answer: No path.

 Does a path exist from node 8 to node 5? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 8 to node 5 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

 Does a path exist from node 2 to node 0? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 2 to node 0 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 2.
- Set the distance to node 2 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Node 6 is directed to nodes 7 (weight: 2).
 Does a path exist from node 0 to node 6? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 0 to node 6 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 0.
- Set the distance to node 0 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node 0 (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 0, we can reach nod and 1. We update the distance to nod and 1.
  - Distance to node 1 (from node 0) is 3, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

2. Select node 1 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 1, we can reach nod and 2. We update the distance to nod and 2.
  - Distance to node 2 (from node 1) is 10, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

3. Select node 2 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 2, we can reach nod and 3. We update the distance to nod and 3.
  - Distance to node 3 (from node 2) is 19, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

4. Select node 3 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 3, we can reach nod and 4. We update the distance to nod and 4.
  - Distance to node 4 (from node 3) is 26, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

5. Select node 4 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 4, we can reach nod and 5. We update the distance to nod and 5.
  - Distance to node 5 (from node 4) is 33, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

6. Select node 5 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 5, we can reach nod and 6. We update the distance to nod and 6.
  - Distance to node 6 (from node 5) is 40, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

7. Select node 6 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 6, we can reach nod and 7. We update the distance to nod and 7.
  - Distance to node 7 (from node 6) is 42, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

8. Select node 7 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 7, we cannot reach any node.

Conclusion
A path exists from node 0 to node 6.
Answer: Node 0 -> Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 3 -> Node 4 -> Node 5 -> Node 6.

Q: Given a directed graph: G describes a directed graph among 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
In this graph:
Node 0 is directed to nodes 1 (weight: 6), 4 (weight: 6), 3 (weight: 6), 2 (weight: 1).
Node 1 is directed to nodes 2 (weight: 4), 4 (weight: 3).
Node 2 is directed to nodes 3 (weight: 7), 1 (weight: 4), 0 (weight: 5).
Node 3 is directed to nodes 4 (weight: 6), 0 (weight: 6).
Node 4 is directed to nodes 1 (weight: 6), 3 (weight: 9), 0 (weight: 5).

Step by Step Process
1. Select node 4 (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 4, we can reach nodes 1, 3 and 0. We update the distances to nodes 1, 3 and 0.
  - Distance to node 1 (from node 4) is 6, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 3 (from node 4) is 9, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 0 (from node 4) is 5, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

2. Select node 0 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 0, we can reach nodes 1, 4, 3 and 2. However, nod and 4 has already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 1, 3 and 2.
  - Distance to node 1 (from node 0) is 11, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 3 (from node 0) is 11, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 2 (from node 0) is 6, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

3. Select node 1 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 1, we can reach nodes 2 and 4. However, nod and 4 has already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 2.
  - Distance to node 2 (from node 1) is 10, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

4. Select node 2 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 2, we can reach nodes 3, 1 and 0. However, nodes 1 and 0 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 3.
  - Distance to node 3 (from node 2) is 13, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

5. Select node 3 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 3, we can reach nodes 4 and 0. However, nodes 4 and 0 have already been selected. We have nothing to update.

Conclusion
A path exists from node 4 to node 2.
Answer: Node 4 -> Node 0 -> Node 2.
