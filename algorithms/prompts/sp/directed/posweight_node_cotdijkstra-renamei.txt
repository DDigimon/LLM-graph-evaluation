Q: Given a directed graph: G describes a directed graph among 14547, 12128, 30512, 54469, and 30619.
In this graph:
Node 14547 is directed to nodes 12128 (weight: 3), 54469 (weight: 9), 30619 (weight: 1).
Node 12128 is directed to nodes 30619 (weight: 6).
Node 54469 is directed to nodes 12128 (weight: 7), 30619 (weight: 8).
Node 30619 is directed to nodes 54469 (weight: 1), 14547 (weight: 5).
 Does a path exist from node 30619 to node 30512? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 30619 to node 30512 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 30619.
- Set the distance to node 30619 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node 30619 (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 30619, we can reach nodes 54469 and 14547. We update the distances to nodes 54469 and 14547.
  - Distance to node 54469 (from node 30619) is 1, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 14547 (from node 30619) is 5, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

2. Select node 54469 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 54469, we can reach nodes 12128 and 30619. However, nod and 30619 has already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 12128.
  - Distance to node 12128 (from node 54469) is 8, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

3. Select node 14547 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 14547, we can reach nodes 12128, 54469 and 30619. However, nodes 54469 and 30619 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 12128.
  - Distance to node 12128 (from node 14547) is 8, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

4. Select node 12128 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 12128, we can reach nod and 30619. However, nod and 30619 has already been selected. We have nothing to update.

ConclusionWe have now considered all possible paths from node 30619 and updated the distances accordingly. Unfortunately, node 30512 was never reached in our exploration, indicating that there is no path from node 30619 to node 30512 in the graph as described.
Answer: No path.

 Does a path exist from node 12847 to node 81715? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 12847 to node 81715 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node 12847 (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 12847, we can reach nod and 84986. We update the distance to nod and 84986.
  - Distance to node 84986 (from node 12847) is 8, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

Node 5867 is directed to nodes 5164 (weight: 5), 79279 (weight: 8), 77061 (weight: 8).
 Does a path exist from node 5164 to node 27525? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 5164 to node 27525 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node 5164.
- Set the distance to node 5164 (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
1. Select node 5164 (smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 5164, we can reach nod and 5867. We update the distance to nod and 5867.
  - Distance to node 5867 (from node 5164) is 6, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

2. Select node 5867 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 5867, we can reach nodes 5164, 79279 and 77061. However, nod and 5164 has already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 79279 and 77061.
  - Distance to node 79279 (from node 5867) is 14, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 77061 (from node 5867) is 14, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

3. Select node 77061 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 77061, we can reach nodes 79279, 5164, 25439, 5867 and 44389. However, nodes 5164 and 5867 have already been selected. We update the distances to nodes 79279, 25439 and 44389.
  - Distance to node 79279 (from node 77061) is 21, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 25439 (from node 77061) is 18, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.
  - Distance to node 44389 (from node 77061) is 19, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

4. Select node 79279 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 79279, we can reach nodes 5867, 25439 and 77061. However, nodes 5867 and 77061 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 25439.
  - Distance to node 25439 (from node 79279) is 21, which is not better than the previous, and will not update the priority queue.

5. Select node 25439 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 25439, we can reach nodes 27525, 5867 and 79279. However, nodes 5867 and 79279 have already been selected. We update the distance to nod and 27525.
  - Distance to node 27525 (from node 25439) is 26, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

6. Select node 44389 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 44389, we can reach nod and 27525. We update the distance to nod and 27525.
  - Distance to node 27525 (from node 44389) is 22, which is better than the previous, update the priority queue.

7. Select node 27525 (next smallest distance in the priority queue). From node 27525, we can reach nodes 5164, 5867 and 25439. However, nodes 5164, 5867 and 25439 have already been selected. We have nothing to update.

Conclusion
A path exists from node 5164 to node 27525.
Answer: Node 5164 -> Node 5867 -> Node 77061 -> Node 44389 -> Node 27525.
