A: To determine if there is a path from node KFZLQ to node ONLKY and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node KFZLQ.
- Set the distance to node KFZLQ (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.

 Does a path exist from node BBNPI to node ZYBQZ? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node BBNPI to node ZYBQZ and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

Initialization
- Start with node BBNPI.
- Set the distance to node BBNPI (the starting node) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.
- Keep a priority queue to select the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been permanently set yet.
- Mark all nodes as unvisited.

Step by Step Process
