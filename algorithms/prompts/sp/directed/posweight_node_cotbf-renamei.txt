 Does a path exist from node 34209 to node 4672? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 34209 to node 4672 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node 34209 in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (14 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- Update distance to 73244 via 34209: 0 + 3 = 3
- Update distance to 97560 via 34209: 0 + 8 = 8
- Update distance to 88295 via 73244: 3 + 1 = 4

Iteration 2:
- Update distance to 80048 via 88295: 4 + 9 = 13
- Update distance to 39328 via 88295: 4 + 8 = 12
- Update distance to 18560 via 80048: 13 + 7 = 20
- Update distance to 32197 via 80048: 13 + 9 = 22

Iteration 3:
- Update distance to 18442 via 39328: 12 + 6 = 18
- Update distance to 32197 via 39328: 12 + 9 = 21
- Update distance to 89548 via 18442: 18 + 4 = 22
- Update distance to 86936 via 18442: 18 + 2 = 20
- Update distance to 62384 via 32197: 21 + 8 = 29
- Update distance to 62384 via 86936: 20 + 6 = 26
- Update distance to 75734 via 18560: 20 + 1 = 21

Iteration 4:
- Update distance to 4672 via 62384: 26 + 7 = 33

Iteration 5:
- No update in a round, stop early.

Therefore, there is a path from node 34209 to node 4672, and the shortest path is Node 34209 -> Node 73244 -> Node 88295 -> Node 39328 -> Node 18442 -> Node 86936 -> Node 62384 -> Node 4672.

 Does a path exist from node 1485 to node 24359? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 1485 to node 24359 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node 1485 in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (14 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- Update distance to 42187 via 1485: 0 + 9 = 9
- Update distance to 35450 via 1485: 0 + 8 = 8
- Update distance to 38509 via 1485: 0 + 8 = 8
- Update distance to 45712 via 1485: 0 + 3 = 3
- Update distance to 67065 via 1485: 0 + 4 = 4
- Update distance to 84409 via 38509: 8 + 1 = 9
- Update distance to 69559 via 38509: 8 + 8 = 16
- Update distance to 19591 via 38509: 8 + 7 = 15
- Update distance to 90718 via 38509: 8 + 3 = 11
- Update distance to 6810 via 38509: 8 + 3 = 11
- Update distance to 78454 via 84409: 9 + 2 = 11
- Update distance to 19697 via 84409: 9 + 3 = 12
- Update distance to 19591 via 84409: 9 + 1 = 10
- Update distance to 69559 via 67065: 4 + 4 = 8
- Update distance to 19697 via 67065: 4 + 6 = 10
- Update distance to 78454 via 67065: 4 + 4 = 8
- Update distance to 6810 via 67065: 4 + 4 = 8

Iteration 2:
- Update distance to 90718 via 35450: 8 + 2 = 10
- Update distance to 42187 via 45712: 3 + 5 = 8
- Update distance to 78454 via 45712: 3 + 4 = 7
- Update distance to 84409 via 45712: 3 + 4 = 7
- Update distance to 19591 via 45712: 3 + 6 = 9
- Update distance to 19697 via 45712: 3 + 4 = 7
- Update distance to 35450 via 45712: 3 + 1 = 4
- Update distance to 19591 via 84409: 7 + 1 = 8

Iteration 3:
- Update distance to 69559 via 35450: 4 + 1 = 5
- Update distance to 90718 via 35450: 4 + 2 = 6
- Update distance to 6810 via 90718: 6 + 1 = 7

Iteration 4:
- No update in a round, stop early.

By examining the graph, we notice that the graph does not show any connection between node 1485 and node 24359. Therefore, based on the graph's connections, the answer is 'No path.'

 Does a path exist from node 74783 to node 19908? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 74783 to node 19908 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:

- Update distance to 84137 via 5122: 18 + 8 = 26
- Update distance to 19908 via 44307: 27 + 5 = 32

Therefore, there is a path from node 74783 to node 19908, and the shortest path is Node 74783 -> Node 6015 -> Node 74588 -> Node 5122 -> Node 44307 -> Node 19908.
