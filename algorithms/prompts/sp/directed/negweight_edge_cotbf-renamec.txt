 Does a path exist from node TSQIX to node LIYXL? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node TSQIX to node LIYXL and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node TSQIX in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (11 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- Update distance to GJCIF via TSQIX: 0 + 7 = 7
- Update distance to GTAHO via GJCIF: 7 + 7 = 14
- Update distance to LIYXL via GTAHO: 14 + 6 = 20
- Update distance to ZITMY via GTAHO: 14 + 4 = 18
- Update distance to LOPHC via LIYXL: 20 + 5 = 25
- Update distance to ESALQ via LOPHC: 25 + 9 = 34

- Update distance to YPRIK via ESALQ: 34 + 2 = 36
- Update distance to RGIDJ via YPRIK: 36 + 8 = 44

Iteration 2:
- Update distance to RGIDJ via ZQNPT: 31 + 5 = 36
- Update distance to BPTNB via RGIDJ: 36 + -3 = 33
- Update distance to BPTNB via ZITMY: 18 + 5 = 23
- Update distance to LIYXL via ZITMY: 18 + -1 = 17
- Update distance to LOPHC via LIYXL: 17 + 5 = 22
- Update distance to ESALQ via LOPHC: 22 + 9 = 31
- Update distance to ZQNPT via LOPHC: 22 + 6 = 28
- Update distance to YPRIK via ESALQ: 31 + 2 = 33

Iteration 3:
