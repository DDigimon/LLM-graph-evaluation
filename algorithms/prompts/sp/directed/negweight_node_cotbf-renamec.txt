 Does a path exist from node FRPSW to node TTJYJ? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node FRPSW to node TTJYJ and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node FRPSW in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (10 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- No update in a round, stop early.

By examining the graph, we notice that the graph does not show any connection between node FRPSW and node TTJYJ. Therefore, based on the graph's connections, the answer is 'No path.'

- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node WHHIW in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (9 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- Update distance to QHAEV via WHHIW: 0 + 4 = 4
- Update distance to JJEKA via WHHIW: 0 + 8 = 8
- Update distance to QWPMS via QHAEV: 4 + -2 = 2
- Update distance to JJEKA via QWPMS: 2 + -1 = 1
- Update distance to GBDSY via QWPMS: 2 + -3 = -1
- Update distance to QZMKG via QWPMS: 2 + 9 = 11
- Update distance to IFAJF via GBDSY: -1 + 5 = 4
- Update distance to QZMKG via GBDSY: -1 + 1 = 0
- Update distance to VTMVS via IFAJF: 4 + 1 = 5
- Update distance to WPJCH via IFAJF: 4 + -1 = 3

Iteration 2:
- No update in a round, stop early.

Therefore, there is a path from node WHHIW to node VTMVS, and the shortest path is Node WHHIW -> Node QHAEV -> Node QWPMS -> Node GBDSY -> Node IFAJF -> Node VTMVS.
