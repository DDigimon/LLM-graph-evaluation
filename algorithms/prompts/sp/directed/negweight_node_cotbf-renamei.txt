 Does a path exist from node 37186 to node 11945? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 37186 to node 11945 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node 37186 in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (13 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:
- Update distance to 25416 via 37186: 0 + 7 = 7

Iteration 2:
- Update distance to 41373 via 25416: 7 + 7 = 14
- Update distance to 63011 via 25416: 7 + 7 = 14
- Update distance to 22182 via 25416: 7 + 0 = 7

Iteration 3:
- Update distance to 94205 via 41373: 14 + -3 = 11
- Update distance to 63011 via 22182: 7 + 5 = 12
- Update distance to 41373 via 22182: 7 + 4 = 11
- Update distance to 72794 via 63011: 12 + 6 = 18
- Update distance to 59528 via 72794: 18 + 3 = 21

Iteration 4:
- Update distance to 59528 via 94205: 11 + 7 = 18
- Update distance to 47192 via 59528: 18 + 7 = 25
- Update distance to 94205 via 41373: 11 + -3 = 8
- Update distance to 10475 via 47192: 25 + 6 = 31
- Update distance to 11945 via 47192: 25 + 8 = 33
- Update distance to 96238 via 47192: 25 + -2 = 23
- Update distance to 11945 via 10475: 31 + -1 = 30

Iteration 5:
- Update distance to 59528 via 94205: 8 + 7 = 15
- Update distance to 72794 via 94205: 8 + 7 = 15
- Update distance to 47192 via 59528: 15 + 7 = 22
- Update distance to 10475 via 96238: 23 + 4 = 27
- Update distance to 11945 via 96238: 23 + 1 = 24
- Update distance to 96238 via 47192: 22 + -2 = 20

Iteration 6:
- Update distance to 10475 via 96238: 20 + 4 = 24
- Update distance to 11945 via 96238: 20 + 1 = 21

Iteration 7:
- No update in a round, stop early.

Therefore, there is a path from node 37186 to node 11945, and the shortest path is Node 37186 -> Node 25416 -> Node 22182 -> Node 41373 -> Node 94205 -> Node 59528 -> Node 47192 -> Node 96238 -> Node 11945.

 Does a path exist from node 69155 to node 90929? If so, provide the shortest path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If not, state "No path.". Let's think step by step using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
A: To determine if there is a path from node 69155 to node 90929 and find the shortest path if it exists, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges, updating the cost to reach each vertex from the source vertex if a shorter path is found.
Given the graph description, let's apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize distances:
- Start with initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the source node (node 69155 in this case), which is set to 0.

2. Relaxation:
- Update distances based on the graph's edges. We'll do this for each edge, for V-1 iterations, where V is the number of vertices (15 in this case). However, we can stop early if there are no updates in a round.

Iteration 1:

- Update distance to 45305 via 51818: 2 + 3 = 5
- Update distance to 64012 via 51818: 2 + 3 = 5
- Update distance to 36906 via 17049: 6 + 0 = 6
- Update distance to 21093 via 64012: 5 + 4 = 9
- Update distance to 42987 via 8906: 9 + 0 = 9

- Update distance to 21093 via 54004: 2 + 6 = 8
- Update distance to 54664 via 34253: 9 + 3 = 12

Iteration 2:
- Update distance to 22306 via 36906: 6 + -2 = 4
- Update distance to 42987 via 45305: 4 + -3 = 1
- Update distance to 8906 via 45305: 4 + 3 = 7
- Update distance to 90929 via 22306: 4 + 7 = 11
- Update distance to 8906 via 42987: 1 + 2 = 3
- Update distance to 65376 via 42987: 1 + 1 = 2

Iteration 3:
- Update distance to 54664 via 65376: 2 + 8 = 10
- Update distance to 22306 via 8906: 3 + -3 = 0
- Update distance to 17049 via 8906: 3 + 2 = 5

Iteration 4:
- Update distance to 90929 via 22306: 0 + 7 = 7
- Update distance to 36906 via 17049: 5 + 0 = 5
